\section{Introduction}
The mTSP (multiple Travel Salesperson Problem) with the objective of minimizing the longest tour length is a slight variation of the well-known TSP problem. Formally, the TSP is defined by a directed graph with costs, and the goal of the problem is to find the shortest path that goes through all the nodes: the idea is that a salesperson needs to visit all the clients in the shortest amount of time. The mTSP is a relaxation of the TSP where multiple salespeople are allowed, and in this study, the graph is fully connected.
